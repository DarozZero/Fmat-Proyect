## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
As students, we have noticed a serious problem among several students which is school desertion. School desertion refers to the abandonment of studies by a student before they have completed their education.

There are different causes that can lead a student to drop out of their studies, such as economic problems, lack of motivation, academic difficulties, family problems, among others. School desertion can have serious consequences in the student's life, such as less opportunity to access well-paid jobs and greater vulnerability to poverty and social exclusion.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The objective of the system will be to provide the necessary help and tools to motivate and guide students who have problems with their studies, are considering abandoning them and do not have the help to access resources that benefit them as students.

## üßëüèΩ Users <a name = "users"></a>

- Students: those who need help and guidance to overcome difficulties and avoid dropping out of school.
- Teachers: who use the application to identify opportunities that students may have.
- Tutors: Those who use the application to identify students and provide assistance.
- Educational institutions: who can use the application as a tool for monitoring and evaluating school performance and the dropout rate of their students.
- Researchers or professionals in education: who can use the application to collect data and carry out studies on school dropout and the causes that generate it.


## üöÄ Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>
Motivation to drop out of school can arise from feeling the need to do so, in search of better opportunities, or from not finding worthwhile reasons to continue studying. As students, we have noticed and experienced this phenomenon during our own studies. We have also conducted interviews with other students who are considering dropping out or who have already done so. Their responses have further highlighted the urgent need to address the issue of school dropout.
