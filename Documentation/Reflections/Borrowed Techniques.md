The original method of navigation design was based on organizing the information, was focused on organizing content and creating a logical structure for it. This involved creating a site map, organizing content into categories, and designing menus and navigation elements to help users find what they need. An example that came to my mind to represent this is navigate through the archives of a computer via console, using the CD and other commands. 
This method has been adapted to the HCI field by focusing more on the user experience and usability of the navigation system. This includes designing navigation elements that are easy to understand and interact with, such as clear labels and intuitive icons. Ensures that users can find the information or functionality they need in an intuitive and efficient manner.
Involving pros of improving the accessibility of navigation systems, being friendly to new or not advanced users itâ€™s the most important aspect to remark. Nevertheless, this can annoy advanced user that are extremely accustomed to navigate by command method, cause first, they had to learn a lot of different things to master this and, in second place, they will have to learn a new way to do this again.
